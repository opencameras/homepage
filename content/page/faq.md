# Why OpenAPI, not gRPC?
It is hard question, and you may find many online documents to compare them. The reason here is mainly author's personal preference.

# Why OpenAPI 2.0, not 3.0?
Some code generation tools only support OpenAPI 2.0, such as https://goswagger.io. To best utilize these tools, the spec is using 2.0 now.
