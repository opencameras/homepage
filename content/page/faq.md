# Why OpenAPI, not gRPC?
It is hard question, and you may find many online documents to compare them. The reason for OpenAPI is mainly author's personal preference, but it can be evolved if needed.

# Why OpenAPI 2.0, not 3.0?
Some code generation tools only support OpenAPI 2.0, such as https://goswagger.io. OpenAPI 2.0 already satisfies the need now, thus, to best utilize these tools, the spec is using 2.0 now.

## How I can contribute the project?
Building a stable, high quality, and reasonable price open camera is challenging. The project is 100% self-funded and independent. Your continued support will help us deliver the 1st generation open camera as early as possible.
