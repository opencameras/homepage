## Privacy, Security, Programmability

As users, we have concerns to stream/store my home security videos in cloud because we never know who are watching, or will watch these feeds, and how long they will keep them, and how secure they can keep them.

As users, we like the convenience and intelligence current IP cameras + cloud offers, but we want to have choice to pair my cameras with other software which may respect more privacy or provide more features.

As developers, we have a dream that one day my home security cameras can have **OPEN APIs** to allow me to
- directly stream video/audio feeds to my mobile applications, browsers whenever I want
- integrate with my smart home solution as I want
- have more freedom and invent new things

## The 1st Webrtc based Open Reference Camera Specification

Below specification is for the 1st reference open camera we like to build:
 - **FHD1080P & Night Vision**: High-quality image in 1080P resolution Day and night, and combined a 100Â° wide lens to cover more spaces clearly.
 - **Dual Video Codec**: H.264 for live webrtc, H.265 for recording to save disk space.
 - **Two-Way Audio**: Equiped with mic & speaker allows you to communicate with the welcomed guests remotely, and deter the stranger around your house.
 - **Intelligent Alerts**: Smart detection to receive the real-time notification of actions and sounds while detected.
 - **Weatherproof**: The IP65 waterproof camera can be placed both indoor and outdoor to keep recording the clear full HD images even rain or shine.
