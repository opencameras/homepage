## Privacy, Security, Programmability

As users, we have concerns to stream/store my home security videos in cloud because we never know who are watching, or will watch these feeds, and how long they will keep them, and how secure they can keep them.

As users, we like the convenience and intelligence current IP cameras + cloud offers, but we want to have choice to pair my cameras with other software which may respect more privacy or provide more features.

As developers, we have a dream that one day my home security cameras can have **OPEN APIs** to allow me to
- directly stream video/audio feeds to my mobile applications, browsers whenever I want
- integrate with my smart home solution as I want
- have more freedom and invent new things
